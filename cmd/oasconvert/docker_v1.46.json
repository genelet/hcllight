It is the API the\nDocker client uses to communicate with the Engine, so everything the Docker\nclient can do can be done with the API.\n\nMost of the client's commands map directly to API endpoints (e.g. `docker ps`\nis `GET /containers/json`). The notable exception is running containers,\nwhich consists of several API calls.\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure\nof the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following\nformat:\n\n```\n{\n  \"message\": \"page not found\"\n}\n```\n\n# Versioning\n\nThe API is usually changed in each release, so API calls are versioned to\nensure that clients don't break. To lock to a specific version of the API,\nyou prefix the URL with its version, for example, call `/v1.30/info` to use\nthe v1.30 version of the `/info` endpoint. If the API version specified in\nthe URL is not supported by the daemon, a HTTP `400 Bad Request` error message\nis returned.\n\nIf you omit the version-prefix, the current version of the API (v1.46) is used.\nFor example, calling `/info` is the same as calling `/v1.46/info`. Using the\nAPI without a version-prefix is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n\nEngine releases in the near future should support this version of the API,\nso your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer Engine.\n\nThe API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties\nto responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and\nrequest body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional\nproperties in responses to ensure they do not break when talking to newer\ndaemons.\n\n\n# Authentication\n\nAuthentication for registries is handled client side. The client has to send\nauthentication details to various endpoints that need to communicate with\nregistries, such as `POST /images/(name)/push`. These are sent as\n`X-Registry-Auth` header as a [base64url encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5)\n(JSON) string with the following structure:\n\n```\n{\n  \"username\": \"string\",\n  \"password\": \"string\",\n  \"email\": \"string\",\n  \"serveraddress\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `serveraddress` is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this\nstructure, double quotes are required.\n\nIf you have already got an identity token from the [`/auth` endpoint](#operation/SystemAuth),\nyou can just pass this instead of credentials:\n\n```\n{\n  \"identitytoken\": \"9cbaf023786cd7...\"\n}\n```\n","title":"Docker Engine API","version":"1.46","x-logo":{"url":"https://docs.docker.com/assets/images/logo-docker-main.png"}},"openapi":"3.0.1","paths":{"/_ping":{"get":{"description":"This is a dummy endpoint you can use to test if the server is accessible.","operationId":"SystemPing","responses":{"200":{"content":{"text/plain":{"schema":{"example":"OK","type":"string"}}},"description":"no error","headers":{"API-Version":{"description":"Max API Version the server supports","schema":{"type":"string"}},"Builder-Version":{"description":"Default version of docker image builder\n\nThe default on Linux is version \"2\" (BuildKit), but the daemon\ncan be configured to recommend version \"1\" (classic Builder).\nWindows does not yet support BuildKit for native Windows images,\nand uses \"1\" (classic builder) as a default.\n\nThis value is a recommendation as advertised by the daemon, and\nit is up to the client to choose which builder to use.\n","schema":{"type":"string"}},"Cache-Control":{"schema":{"type":"string"}},"Docker-Experimental":{"description":"If the server is running with experimental mode enabled","schema":{"type":"boolean"}},"Pragma":{"schema":{"type":"string"}},"Swarm":{"description":"Contains information about Swarm status of the daemon,\\nand if the daemon is acting as a manager or worker node.","schema":{"enum":["inactive","pending","error","locked","active/worker","active/manager"],"type":"string"}}},"links":{}},"500":{"content":{"text/plain":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}},"description":"server error","headers":{"Cache-Control":{"schema":{"type":"string"}},"Pragma":{"schema":{"type":"string"}}},"links":{}}},"summary":"Ping","tags":["System"]},"head":{"description":"This is a dummy endpoint you can use to test if the server is accessible.","operationId":"SystemPingHead","responses":{"200":{"content":{"text/plain":{"schema":{"example":"(empty)","type":"string"}}},"description":"no error","headers":{"API-Version":{"description":"Max API Version the server supports","schema":{"type":"string"}},"Builder-Version":{"description":"Default version of docker image builder","schema":{"type":"string"}},"Cache-Control":{"schema":{"type":"string"}},"Docker-Experimental":{"description":"If the server is running with experimental mode enabled","schema":{"type":"boolean"}},"Pragma":{"schema":{"type":"string"}},"Swarm":{"description":"Contains information about Swarm status of the daemon,\\nand if the daemon is acting as a manager or worker node.","schema":{"enum":["inactive","pending","error","locked","active/worker","active/manager"],"type":"string"}}},"links":{}},"500":{"content":{"text/plain":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}},"description":"server error","headers":{},"links":{}}},"summary":"Ping","tags":["System"]}},"/auth":{"post":{"description":"Validate credentials for a registry and, if available, get an identity\\ntoken for accessing the registry without password.","operationId":"SystemAuth","requestBody":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/AuthConfig"}}},"description":"Authentication to check"},"responses":{"200":{"content":{"application/json":{"example":null,"schema":{"properties":{"IdentityToken":{"description":"An opaque token used to authenticate a user after a successful login","type":"string"},"Status":{"description":"The status of the authentication","type":"string"}},"required":["Status"],"title":"SystemAuthResponse","type":"object"}}},"description":"An identity token was generated successfully.","headers":{},"links":{}},"204":{"content":{},"description":"No error","headers":{},"links":{}},"401":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}},"description":"Auth error","headers":{},"links":{}},"500":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}},"description":"Server error","headers":{},"links":{}}},"summary":"Check auth configuration","tags":["System"],"x-codegen-request-body-name":"authConfig"}},"/build":{"post":{"description":"Build an image from a tar archive with a `Dockerfile` in it.\n\nThe `Dockerfile` specifies how the image is built from the tar archive.

You can attach\nto the same container multiple times and you can reattach to containers\nthat have been detached.\n\nEither the `stream` or `logs` parameter must be `true` for this endpoint\nto do anything.\n\nSee the [documentation for the `docker attach` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/)\nfor more details.\n\n### Hijacking\n\nThis endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to transport `stdin`, `stdout`,\nand `stderr` on the same socket.\n\nThis is the response from the daemon for an attach request:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream\n\n[STREAM]\n```\n\nAfter the headers and two new lines, the TCP connection can now be used\nfor raw, bidirectional communication between the client and server.\n\nTo hint potential proxies about connection hijacking, the Docker client\ncan also optionally send connection upgrade headers.\n\nFor example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:\n\n```\nPOST /containers/16253994b7c4/attach?stream=1\u0026stdout=1 HTTP/1.1\nUpgrade: tcp\nConnection: Upgrade\n```\n\nThe Docker daemon will respond with a `101 UPGRADED` response, and will\nsimilarly follow with the raw stream:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED\nContent-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream\nConnection: Upgrade\nUpgrade: tcp\n\n[STREAM]\n```\n\n### Stream format\n\nWhen the TTY setting is disabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate),\nthe HTTP Content-Type header is set to application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream\nand the stream over the hijacked connected is multiplexed to separate out\n`stdout` and `stderr`. The stream consists of a series of frames, each\ncontaining a header and a payload.\n\nThe header contains the information which the stream writes (`stdout` or\n`stderr`). It also contains the size of the associated frame encoded in\nthe last four bytes (`uint32`).\n\nIt is encoded on the first eight bytes like this:\n\n```go\nheader := [8]byte{STREAM_TYPE, 0, 0, 0, SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4}\n```\n\n`STREAM_TYPE` can be:\n\n- 0: `stdin` (is written on `stdout`)\n- 1: `stdout`\n- 2: `stderr`\n\n`SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4` are the four bytes of the `uint32` size\nencoded as big endian.\n\nFollowing the header is the payload, which is the specified number of\nbytes of `STREAM_TYPE`.\n\nThe simplest way to implement this protocol is the following:\n\n1. Read 8 bytes.\n2. Choose `stdout` or `stderr` depending on the first byte.\n3. Extract the frame size from the last four bytes.\n4. Read the extracted size and output it on the correct output.\n5. Goto 1.\n\n### Stream format when using a TTY\n\nWhen the TTY setting is enabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate),\nthe stream is not multiplexed. The data exchanged over the hijacked\nconnection is simply the raw data from the process PTY and client's\n`stdin`.\n","operationId":"ContainerAttach","parameters":[{"description":"ID or name of the container","in":"path","name":"id","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}},{"description":"Override the key sequence for detaching a container.Format is a single\ncharacter `[a-Z]` or `ctrl-\u003cvalue\u003e` where `\u003cvalue\u003e` is one of: `a-z`,\n`@`, `^`, `[`, `,` or `_`.\n","in":"query","name":"detachKeys","schema":{"type":"string"}},{"description":"Replay previous logs from the container.\n\nThis is useful for attaching to a container that has started and you\nwant to output everything since the container started.\n\nIf `stream` is also enabled, once all the previous output has been\nreturned, it will seamlessly transition into streaming current\noutput.\n","in":"query","name":"logs","schema":{"type":"boolean"}},{"description":"Stream attached streams from the time the request was made onwards.","in":"query","name":"stream","schema":{"type":"boolean"}},{"description":"Attach to `stdin`","in":"query","name":"stdin","schema":{"type":"boolean"}},{"description":"Attach to `stdout`","in":"query","name":"stdout","schema":{"type":"boolean"}},{"description":"Attach to `stderr`","in":"query","name":"stderr","schema":{"type":"boolean"}}],"responses":{"101":{"content":{},"description":"no error, hints proxy about hijacking","headers":{},"links":{}},"200":{"content":{},"description":"no error, no upgrade header found","headers":{},"links":{}},"400":{"content":{"application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}},"application/vnd.docker.raw-stream":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}},"description":"bad parameter","headers":{},"links":{}},"404":{"content":{"application/json":{"example":{"message":"No such container: c2ada9df5af8"}},"application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}},"application/vnd.docker.raw-stream":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}},"description":"no such container","headers":{},"links":{}},"500":{"content":{"application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}},"application/vnd.docker.raw-stream":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}},"description":"server error","headers":{},"links":{}}},"summary":"Attach to a container","tags":["Container"]}},"/containers/{id}/attach/ws":{"get":{"operationId":"ContainerAttachWebsocket","parameters":[{"description":"ID or name of the container","in":"path","name":"id","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}},{"description":"Override the key sequence for detaching a container.Format is a single\ncharacter `[a-Z]` or `ctrl-\u003cvalue\u003e` where `\u003cvalue\u003e` is one of: `a-z`,\n`@`, `^`, `[`, `,`, or `_`.\n","in":"query","name":"detachKeys","schema":{"type":"string"}},{"description":"Return logs","in":"query","name":"logs","schema":{"type":"boolean"}},{"description":"Return stream","in":"query","name":"stream","schema":{"type":"boolean"}},{"description":"Attach to `stdin`","in":"query","name":"stdin","schema":{"type":"boolean"}},{"description":"Attach to `stdout`","in":"query","name":"stdout","schema":{"type":"boolean"}},{"description":"Attach to `stderr`","in":"query","name":"stderr","schema":{"type":"boolean"}}],"responses":{"101":{"content":{},"description":"no error, hints proxy about hijacking","headers":{},"links":{}},"200":{"content":{},"description":"no error, no upgrade header found","headers":{},"links":{}},"400":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}},"text/plain":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}},"description":"bad parameter","headers":{},"links":{}},"404":{"content":{"application/json":{"example":{"message":"No such container: c2ada9df5af8"},"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}},"text/plain":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}},"description":"no such container","headers":{},"links":{}},"500":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}},"text/plain":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}},"description":"server error","headers":{},"links":{}}},"summary":"Attach to a container via a websocket","tags":["Container"]}},"/containers/{id}/changes":{"get":{"description":"Returns which files in a container's filesystem have been added, deleted,\nor modified.
